A Croos Over Project between 3 midulrs:
Object Oriented Constructs (OOC)
Linear Algebra (LA)
Databases (DB)

The progect has been complited by two members of the team. 
Personal contribution(Liudmial Stolbetskaia).
Programming and solving 2 and 3 linear equations. Took part in creating the frame of the databace. Visualisation of the nodes of the databaase. 

Linear Algebra
•	MLO2: Recognise the equations of lines and planes in two and three dimensions, utilise this information in the formation of connected lines and planes (Linked to PLO 4 (Stage 1/2 SLO 4))
•	MLO3: Perform basic matrix computations (Linked to PLO 1 (Stage 1/2 SLO 1))
•	MLO4: Solve a linear system using various methods (Linked to PLO 1 (Stage 1/2 SLO 1))
•	MLO5: Compute the determinant and inverse of an invertible matrix (Linked to PLO 1 (Stage 1/2 SLO 1))

Object Oriented Constructs
•	MLO 3. Plan, design and document a proposed solution to a given problem, present and justify decisions taken for implementation of said solution to peers and stakeholders.
•	MLO 4. Understand and apply best practices in Object Oriented Programming in the production of software and in the production of requirements definition documentation.
•	MLO 5. Operate both as an individual and as part of a multidisciplinary team to produce software solutions to well defined requirements

Databases
•	MLO1: Understand the fundamental concepts of relational databases, database management systems (DBMS), Integrity constraints and applications of relational database models. (Linked to PLO 1 (Stage 1/2 SLO 1))
•	MLO2: Demonstrate and implement data definition and manipulation language at the basic and advanced levels using SQL. (Linked to PLO 2, PLO 3 (Stage 1/2 SLO 2 / SLO 3))
